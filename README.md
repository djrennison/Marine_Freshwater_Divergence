# Marine_Freshwater_Divergence

Analysis_Final.R contains the R script used to estimate the magnitude of morphological divergence and parallelism. It also contains the code for conducting all of the linear models used to test for associations with environment and distance. 

Size_corrected_values_fixed_final_no_bowen.csv contains the raw and size corrected morphological estimates for all of the fish included in the data as well as associated meta data. It is the core input file for the "Analysis_Final.R" script 

differences.csv contains the estimated differences in pc values between pairs of marine and freshwater sites. It is an input file for a downstream analysis in the "Analysis_Final.R" script 

GeoDist_Matrix.csv contains the geographic distances between sites. It is an input file for a downstream analysis in the "Analysis_Final.R" script 

Climate.csv contains the raw bio-climate data for all sites. It is an input file for a downstream analysis in the "Analysis_Final.R" script
